// File created by Pedro Souto - This file WAS NOT given to us by the professor
// This is the file where we will implement all the functionalities professor asked
// From instructions: The driver should be interactive (with all built in commands) to list directories, create directories, add and remove files, copy files, move files, setting meta data, and two “special commands” one to copy from the normal filesystem to your filesystem and the other from your filesystem to the normal filesystem

#include "fsImplementation.h"

// List directories

// Create directory

// Add file

// Remove file

// Cope file

// Move file

// Set metadata

// Copy from the normal filesystem to your filesystem

// Copy from your filesystem to the normal filesystem
