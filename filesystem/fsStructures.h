 Description: File System Permissions Explained
 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions
 The read permission grants the ability to read a file. When set for a directory, this permission grants the ability to read the names of files in the directory, but not to find out any further information about them such as contents, file type, size, ownership, permissions.
 The write permission grants the ability to modify a file. When set for a directory, this permission grants the ability to modify entries in the directory, which includes creating files, deleting files, and renaming files. Note that this requires that execute is also set; without it, the write permission is meaningless for directories.
 The execute permission grants the ability to execute a file. This permission must be set for executable programs, in order to allow the operating system to run them. When set for a directory, the execute permission is interpreted as the search permission: it grants the ability to access file contents and meta-information if its name is known, but not list files inside the directory, unless read is set also.
 
 ** A bit of 0 means access denied, a bit of 1 means access granted **
 1st bit:   Other execute
 2nd bit:   Other write
 3rd bit:   Other read
 4th bit:   Group execute
 5th bit:   Group write
 6th bit:   Group read
 7th bit:   User execute
 8th bit:   User write
 9th bit:   User read
 Bits 9-16: Unused, saved for later functionalities
